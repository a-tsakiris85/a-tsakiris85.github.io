    "This paid, part-time job is definitely one of my favorite parts of my Cornell experience thus far. I get to independently lead tours of the entire campus for incoming students and other visitors on a weekly basis. I love sharing my experiences with high schoolers who are going through what I went through just a couple of years ago. In addition to giving tours, I also answer the phone on the main university switch-board, work the desk at the Welcome Center, and even give out permits and information at the parking booths!",

    "As an incoming freshman, I decided to go on a 6 day pre-orientation backpacking trip with Outdoor Odyssey, a student-led group on campus. I loved the experience so much I became a guide myself! In addition to training throughout the year, I have now led 2 four-day backpacking trips in the Finger Lake regions with 8 trippers each. I love being in the outdoors, sharing my knowledge and advice about Cornell with incoming freshmen, and helping people feel welcome and wanted during their transition to college life!",

Events I organized included the First Annual Professional Fraternity March Madness Challenge (50+ participants, $200 donated to charity), a 'Guiding Eyes for the Blind' Dog Petting and Fundraising Event, and a visit to an Ithaca Elementary School to talk about Computer Science and Engineering!",
